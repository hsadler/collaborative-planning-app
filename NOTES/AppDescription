App description:

- Create a poll. A user creates a poll and can share this with other people
	(this could for example be a code or a link).

- Join a pre-existing poll created by you or someone else. You should be able to
	cast your vote on different points in a predefined set
	(0, 1/2, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13). A user can only vote once, but is permitted to
	change their vote.

- Visualize the results in real-time of a poll: Anyone should be able to see the
	results of a poll. If user A is casting a vote "2", user B should in
	real-time be able to see that the point "2" has a value of 1.
