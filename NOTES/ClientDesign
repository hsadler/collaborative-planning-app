Top-Nav:
	- "Home" -> '/'
	- "Tasks" -> '/tasks'
	- displays user if user has been selected


Pages:

	'/':
		- displays site title
		- 'select user' or 'create user' buttons nav to respective views

	'/user-create':
		- user_name field
		- once submitted nav to '/tasks'

	'/user-select':
		- lists users
		- user click navs to '/tasks'
		- 'create user' button navs to '/user-create'
	
	'/tasks':
		- lists tasks
		- task click navs to '/task/<task_id>'
		- 'create task' button creates task and navs to it
	
	'/task/<task_id>':

		- displays vote variant quantities
		- vote variant click results in vote create/update


Special Behavior:

	- view of /task without being signed in gives option to select user in order 
		to vote, and voting is blocked until user is selected
